# 4 Player Local Multiplayer Game (2023)

Returning to the role of sole programmer and project lead, the other three developers fulfilled their role of 3D Modelers and Concept Artist. Programming required an abundance of time but quality control, environmental lighting and UI design was accomplished alongside it.

This module lasted about five months (pre-production to post), presented to Radical Forge’s Stephen Hey and shown to PlayStation’s Byron Atkinson-Jones at NextGen’s Graduate Showcase at BAFTA HQ (London) on the 30th June 2023. Initially played with four xbox controllers and produced within editor version 2021.3.16f1 of Unity. Players must knock each other off the platform, which can be accomplished by dashing or stunning one another.
